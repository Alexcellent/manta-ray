Installation and Compiling
--------------------------

This program was last compiled and run using Visual Studio 2012 on a lab computer.
You should be able to run the program on the lab computers directly. Performance is
best when run without the debugger `(ctrl + f5)`.

All pre-fabricated animation files are contained in `./model/<filename>.anim`,
the same directory as the `skeleton.out` and `weights.out` files. The program
loads `load.anim` by default or when `L` is pressed, and saves to `save.anim`
when `S` is pressed. Arguments of the form ``./model/<filename>.anim` passed
to the program will load this animation file instead.

Interpolation methods are selected using `1-4`, as specified in the handout, and
pressing `m` will make the animation. All controls matched the handout's
specifications in terms of iterating through keyframes and animation frames

Sources
-------

Algorithms form interpolation and quaternion class were based of information
provided both in the course slides and on the web, as well as based on some
of the quaternion functions provided in `simpleMath.h` in A1 CodeBase. Where
external sources were used, the source is acknowledged in the comments next to
the applicable code/function.

Write-Up
--------

**Quaternion Class:**

For this assignment, my own Quaternion class was written. In fact it is a
struct as I required public access to quaternion values. This struct contains
a float array of size 4 representing the quaternion values `{w, x, y, z}`.
It also includes overloaded operators for quaternion operations, and
conversion functions to convert:
		-	quat to matrix
		-	quat to euler
		-	axis-angle to quat
</br>

**Joint Local Rotations:**

Local Rotations for each joint are stored as quaternions. When the function
`updateGlobalTransforms()` is called, their current global transform is stored
in a 4*4 matrix (a 1D array of 16 floats).

**Key-frames and Animation-frames:**

A frame is the list of 17 quaternions, one for each joint (excluding the root).
The `skeleton` object holds 2 vectors:

		std::vector<Quat*> keyframes
		std::vector<Quat*> animframes

In edit mode, keyframes can be added to the keyframe vector with the `+` key.
When switched to animation mode, the animframes vector is cleared, and the
entire animation is interpolated using the selected interpolation method
(selected with keys 1-4 as specified in handout)

The following functions are used to load the desired frames local joint
rotations into the skeleton, and to update the global transformations:

		void nextKeyFrame();
    	void prevKeyFrame();
    	void nextAnimFrame();
    	void prevAnimFrame();

**Observations:**

As expected, I find both quaternion-based interpolation methods give
the smoothest results. Matrix and Euler occasionally move in unexpected
directions. These is easily seen when running the 3 provided animation files
(`wave.anim, break.anim, dance.anim`)	with all 4 methods.
